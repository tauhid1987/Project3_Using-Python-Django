# Project 3 #

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

## Pizza ##

 In this project, I’ll build an web application for handling a pizza restaurant’s online orders. Users will be able to browse the restaurant’s menu, add items to their cart, and submit their orders. Meanwhile, the restaurant owners will be able to add and update menu items, and view orders that have been placed.

## python files ## 
   - manage.py for run program

## App ## 
   - Orders
   
## 12 html templates ##
   - home.html for home page
   - register.html for registration

   - order1.html for Stripe order
   - orders.html only for admin view    
   - status.html only for admin view
   - success.html for order success message

**Hints: Personal Touch: Integrating with the Stripe API to allow users to actually use a credit card to make a purchase during checkout, and supporting sending users a confirmation email once their purchase is complete using to use environment variables and also try to insert pending and complete status.**
